  <Overview>The deceased, a pub owner from Horsens and an old acquaintance of the police, was discovered after being liquidated. He also has outstanding business with the local bikers. But Ingrid thinks the motive for the homicide is more of a personal nature. The larger mobile office is put to use for the first time and its driver proves to be a surprise. Just as the investigation gets underway Ingrid receives a phone call that forces her to rush back to Copenhagen. Part one of a two part episode.</Overview>
