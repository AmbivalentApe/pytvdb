  <Overview>Local police overhears a shooting. A teenage girl comes running against them yelling &quot;They're gonna kill me, they're gonna kill me!&quot;. The female police officer finds the body of Irana and Fashad Adavi in the apartment of Osmand and Leyla Güre. The reason for the murder is believed to be a matter of honour according to Osmand as he explains that Fashad supposedly has raped Yasemin, the daughter of Osmand and Leyla. The son, Dennis, supposedly shoots Fashad as he refuses to marry Yasemin. In questioning, Dennis fails to reload the pistol and is therefore not the murderer. Yasemin then claims she shot the victims. In a gynaecological examination, Yasemin proves to be a virgin. As the gynaecologist talks with Dahl, Yasemin escapes and, according to her home room teacher, hides in a botanical facility. The teacher explains that Osmand has sexually abused his daughter anally for years. IP finds the girl in time, as her father is trying to kill her with a piece of glass. In questioning, Yasemin explains that Fashad found out about her father and tried to force through a wedding with Osmand, who then kills her.</Overview>

  <Overview>The body of the 10-year-old is found in a stream in the woods just outside of Hellebæk. No boy of the description is missing. La Cour dreams of a bag that is found at the harbour and has exactly the same interior as in La Cours dream. A social licence from the bag reveals the boy to be Martin Simonsen. DNA samples proves that the killer earlier has murdered a young boy. La Cour talks with a conductor from Odense, Claus Munk Andersen, who claims he didn't see the boy. But through a vision and investigation of other witnesses, Andersen is taken into custody. A DNA sample proves him to be the killer, but when the police moves out to arrest him, they find him hanged in his house and La Cour's fingerprints all over the place.</Overview>

  <Overview>La Cour is taken into custody and is ordered home to Copenhagen. In the mean time, the investigation team contacts Karin, the sister of Andersen who tells them that the man that visited Andersen the night he was killed and had sexual intercourse with him probably is Sonny, a local male prostitute. Fischer is sent to the dumpster, where he finds a trash bag that contains Andersen's diary that contains information about the murdered boys and Cliff &quot;Sonny&quot; Jensen, whom Andersen raised into prostitution and lent to his friends. La Cour notices some ash buds and remembers what happened at Andersen's, paying Ulrik Gregersen, Andersen's brother-in-law a visit. He follows him to the dumpster where he arrests him and discovers that the trash bags he dumped there contained the body of Sonny.</Overview>

  <Overview>Christian and Andreas Dahl are shot when they confront two famous criminals in burying stolen money in Kalundborg. Tina Lauritsen, the wife of Christian, is later found with her throat slit. The criminals are quickly identified, as a burned out white Mercedes is found containing rabbit dung (as Eik Nielsen, the male criminal, favours white Mercedes and Anja Jespersen, the female criminal, always carry around a rabbit). Unit One puts the area where the money was buried under surveillance. When the couple shows up, the Special Police Corps surround them, but they manage to escape into the church where a small group of people were arranging baptising schedules. Eik lets the grown ups escape and the priest, the wife of a local police officer, manages to text message Unit One and ask them to open the Northern Door to let Anja escape with the infant. The Special Police Corps manages to successfully rescue the priest and take Eik into custody.</Overview>

  <Overview>A hotel is set on fire in Nyborg, killing 32 people. A local pyromaniac, Henning Jørgensen, is taken into questioning, but fails to answer where the fire started. In a side story, a little boy witnesses how a bespectacled man places the corpse of a young woman on a bench in a parking lot. In a picture from the local newspaper, a face is very faintly viewed in the background, and the police trace the person in the picture to be Otto Lykke Larsen, a mentally retarded man. Larsen is taken into questioning. In the videos found in Larsen's apartment, fires are videotaped and Unit One suspects that Larsen was the pyromaniac responsible. In other videos, Larsen has sexual intercourse with a woman, Britt Hjort Jespersen. In questioning, Larsen admits that he was the one who set fire on the hotel, along with all the other fires recorded in his videotapes. In the mean time, the corpse of the young woman is identified as Jespersen. Larsen admits he killed Jespersen.</Overview>

  <Overview>Bertel Kjeldsen calls Dahl late at night to ask her to come to Fredensborg where he allegedly killed his own wife. In the meantime, the case of Britt Hjort Jespersen is brought up again as a poor autopsy of the body wasn't satisfactory. DNA samples from a new autopsy show DNA from another man. Dahl tries hard to find Keldsen, who is standing at the edge of a tall building when Dahl finds him. He tells how he killed his wife and how his son, Knud Kjeldsen, killed Jespersen. Dahl arrests Knud. Knud lies under questioning, but the DNA samples show that Knud's biological brother, Robin Hansen, who is mentally retarded, was the murderer. Knud tried to cover for his retarded brother to spare his family.</Overview>
